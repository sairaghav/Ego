Ego_v1 offers basic capabilities such as:

1. **Switch windows (Equivalent of Win+Tab):**
	The command 'switch windows' will display all opened windows. The required window can be chosen by the commands:
	- Windows 10: 'left'/'right'/'up'/'down' to choose the window and 'select' to focus it to the foreground
	- Windows 7: 'previous'/'next' to choose the window and 'select' to focus it to the foreground
		
	Saying 'escape' at any point after 'switch windows' will change the focus to the original window in the foreground.
	
2. **Play music (Play music from YouTube):**
	The command 'play music' will ask you for the song to be played. The song requested by the user will be played on YouTube. You can give other commands to Ego while the song is being played in the background.
	
3. **Search Google:**
	The command 'search' will ask you for the query to be searched. The requested keyword will then be searched in Google.
	
4. **Control volume:**

	- increase volume
	- decrease volume
	- mute volume
	- unmute volume
	
5. **Take notes:**
	The command 'take notes' will record everything you say and store it in a text file. Once you are done with your notes, please say 'end of notes' to stop the recording.
